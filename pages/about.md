The company was founded by Robert Ruff, who has over 20+ years driving experience. 

RTM specializes in small to medium cargo. Our fleet is comprised of cargo vans and box trucks. 
We service New Jersey, New York, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia, and Pittsburgh.

RTM offers a variety of services in the logistics and shipping industry, these include: warehousing, shipping, transportation, and site management. We are able to handle many loads, as we can use cargo vans or box trucks. 

We specialize in fragile cargo, but can accommodate pallets as well. Our work brings us up and down the Eastern United States, but we usually stick to the Northeast.
